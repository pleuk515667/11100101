I think we have the serial.read working. This should work for what we need to read sensor data.

readStat Function:
data = serial.read(1)
byte = struct.unpack('B',data)[0]

Then have a function for checking each bit:

bool(byte & 0x00) 1st
bool(byte & 0x02) 2nd
bool(byte & Ox04) 3rd
bool(byte & 0x08) 4th
bool(byte & 0x10) 5th
bool(byte & 0x20) 6th
bool(byte & 0x40) 7th
bool(byte & 0x80) 8th

pass the return into a check function:

if(bool == True):
	then active

else
	then nonactive

Hopefully then we will have a working sensor check.
